City Block II Mod v2.0
By Leslie E. Krause

City Block II disables use of water and lava buckets within a designated area around spawn 
and also sends aggressive players to a central jail. The mod was inspired by the original 
"city_block", developed by lag01 for the just test server.

To craft a city block, you will need to arrange seven sandstone blocks in a square around 
one mese block in the craft grid (this is a far less expensive recipe than the former mod, 
which hopefully encourages players to co-operatively protect public spaces from griefing.

The range of each city block is 21 meters in all four cardinal directions, extending
infinitely upward, but downward only to -100 meters. Placing a city block at any depth
below -100 will result in it being non-functional.

As a convenience, you can punch the city block to activate the boundary display, which can 
aid in more accurate placement.

By right-clicking on a city block after placement, you can override the default protection 
behavior and monitor the corresponding interception metrics.

 o Disable Jail on PvP
 o Allow Water Buckets
 o Allow Lava Buckets

Keep in mind, if you are installing this mod in a world that has existing city blocks from 
the original "city_block" mod, they will continue to function as expected. However, the 
interface to override the default protection behavior and to monitor the interception 
metrics will be unavailable until youmanually dig and replace the city block.
